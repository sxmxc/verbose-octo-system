# API Checker Overview

## Purpose
The API Checker accelerates HTTP endpoint validation by giving operators a scriptable request composer, response inspector, and sharable history so regressions and outage details can be captured in minutes.

## Primary Workflows
1. **Compose requests quickly.** Choose an HTTP method, set the URL, and add query parameters or headers with on/off toggles to mirror real client behaviour.
2. **Control authentication and payloads.** Switch between raw and JSON bodies, set explicit content types, and configure basic, bearer, or API key authentication before dispatching the call.
3. **Inspect responses in depth.** Review status metadata, headers, formatted bodies, and size metrics to confirm expectations or identify service defects.
4. **Track history for handoffs.** Save each execution automatically, replay useful requests, and export response details while collaborating during incidents.
