# Internal Documentation

This directory captures engineering-facing guides that complement the operator-facing content shipped in `frontend/documentation`.

- Use `docs/prompt-engineering` for agent instructions, evaluation criteria, and conversational playbooks.
- Add architecture, coding standards, and contribution guidelines as separate Markdown files so the repository stays self-documenting.
- Explore `docs/toolkit-authoring` for step-by-step guides covering backend services, frontend integration, testing, and release workflows for new toolkits.

See `README.md` at the repository root for a higher-level overview.
