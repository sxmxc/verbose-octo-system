# Internal Documentation

This directory captures engineering-facing guides that complement the operator-facing content shipped in `frontend/documentation`.

- Start with `docs/runtime-architecture.md` for a service-by-service breakdown (API, worker, Vault, Redis, Postgres, toolkit storage).
- Use `docs/prompt-engineering` for agent instructions, evaluation criteria, and conversational playbooks.
- Explore `docs/toolkit-authoring` for backend, worker, and frontend integration workflows when shipping new toolkits.
- Review `docs/authentication/providers.md` for Vault-backed OIDC/LDAP/AD configuration patterns.
- Keep coding standards and contribution guidelines (`docs/coding-standards.md`, `docs/contributing.md`) close at hand to align reviews.

See `README.md` at the repository root for a higher-level overview.
