# Context7 – SRE Toolbox

1. **Platform topology** – The Toolbox pairs a React App Shell with a FastAPI control plane, Celery worker, Redis, PostgreSQL, and Vault; review the system map and component responsibilities in `README.md` and `docs/runtime-architecture.md` before proposing changes that touch cross-service flows.
2. **Service interactions & data flow** – API routers, Celery tasks, and toolkit runtime adapters live under `backend/` and publish job telemetry into Redis while persisting state in PostgreSQL; consult `backend/README.md` (if present) and inline module docs plus `docs/project-setup.md` for connection string guidance and worker orchestration expectations.
3. **Toolkit lifecycle** – Bundled toolkits and packaging utilities live in `toolkits/` with shared runtime glue under `toolkit_runtime/`; study `docs/toolkit-authoring/` and `README.md`'s repository layout section when authoring or debugging toolkit assets so module loading stays compatible with the runtime injector.
4. **Security & secrets posture** – `.env` values feed Compose, API, and worker processes; operators must set unique JWT secrets, Vault credentials, and database passwords (`docs/project-setup.md`, `README.md` quick start, and `docs/authentication/` explain the minimums). Avoid committing secrets and ensure Vault bootstrap instructions remain accurate.
5. **Local development & testing** – Use `docker-compose.yml` / `docker-compose.prod.yml` for container orchestration and `test-all.sh` or targeted `npm test` / `pytest` runs for validation; update onboarding notes in `README.md` or `docs/project-setup.md` if workflows change.
6. **Backlog & automation state** – Task selection and status live in `docs/TODO.yaml`, with machine-readable progress in `ai/state/progress.json` and narrative entries in `ai/state/journal.md`; follow `ai/ops/codex.md` when coordinating multi-session work.
7. **Documentation, citations & PRs** – Observe repository-wide instructions in `AGENTS.md` and match contributions with explicit file-path citations in summaries and journals; run required checks, update docs alongside code, and capture rationale in the journal before opening a PR.
