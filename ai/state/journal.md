# Codex Journal

Track Codex sessions chronologically. Each entry should capture what was attempted, what landed, and which TODO items changed.

## 2024-05-30 Setup
- Established persistent state files (`docs/TODO.yaml`, `ai/state/progress.json`, `ai/state/journal.md`).
- Consolidated prompt engineering guidance into `ai/ops/codex.md` so future sessions share the same playbook.
- Pending work: pick an item from the backlog and record it under `active_task` when execution begins.
